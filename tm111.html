      <h2>TM111 Programming and Problem Solving</h2>
      <p>
        This page contains evidence from my TM111 work, including Scratch programs that demonstrate algorithms, variables,
        lists, testing, and debugging.
      </p>

      <h2>Project 1 , Scratch program evidence</h2>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        A series of structured programming tasks completed as part of TM111, focused on understanding program logic,
        data handling, and problem decomposition.
      </p>

      <h3>What I did</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Designed and built small programs using Scratch</li>
        <li>Implemented algorithms using sequence, selection, and iteration</li>
        <li>Used variables and lists to store and process data</li>
        <li>Tested and debugged programs to ensure correct behaviour</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Tools and technologies</h3>
      <p>Scratch, algorithm design, computational thinking</p>

      <h3>What I learned</h3>
      <p>
        This project strengthened my understanding of how programs process data step by step. I learned how to translate
        problems into logical instructions and how to test and refine solutions when errors occurred.
      </p>

      <h3>Short description of what the program does and how it works</h3>
      <p>
        When the green flag is clicked, the program asks the user to calculate the price increase between an old price and
        a new price. The user’s answer is stored in a variable and compared against the correct calculated value. If the
        answer is correct, the program displays confirmation feedback. If the answer is incorrect, the program displays
        the correct price increase.
      </p>

      <h3>Problem statement</h3>
      <p>
        When learning programming, it can be difficult to understand how numerical data, user input, and conditional logic
        work together in a single program. Without clear examples, learners may struggle to see how variables store values
        and how decisions are made based on comparisons. This program demonstrates how user input can be processed,
        checked, and responded to using variables and selection.
      </p>

      <h3>The idea</h3>
      <p>
        The idea was to create an interactive Scratch program that asks the user a question involving price changes,
        calculates the correct answer internally, and then checks the user’s response to provide immediate feedback.
      </p>

      <h3>Brief reflection</h3>
      <p>
        This idea was stronger than others because it clearly demonstrates multiple programming concepts working together,
        including variables, calculations, user input, and conditional logic. The program also produces clear feedback,
        making it easy to test, debug, and explain.
